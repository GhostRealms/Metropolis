Since it's a bit clear the governments etc are a bit separate from the actual Metropolis plugin, King and I have kept a separate repo for it, on my own account. It's public, so you can take a look whenever; although it only really has pseudo-code in it right now, so we can grasp the concept better. 
This way, he and I can effectively help you with the core features of Metropolis. To clarify: Actual development on the governments and wars branch of Metropolis is delayed, but in the meantime he and I will be discussing its implementation. During said delay, he and I will be able to assist with the core functionality of this plugin.
Keep in mind, however, King doesn't have as much experience with Bukkit as we do, which is why, at the moment, it's good to have him help with pseudo-code so we know how to tackle these problems.
I look forward to continued work on this plugin and others.
